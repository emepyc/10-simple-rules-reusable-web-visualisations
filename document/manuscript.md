# Ten Simple Rules for Writing Reusable Web Visualisations

# Abstract
Browsersâ€™ performance has increased hugely; a process which has happened hand in hand with the latest advances and standardisation of key technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 and ECMASscript (formerly JavaScript) and the commoditization of network computing resources (i.e. cloud computing). All these factors have enabled the web to incorporate well established ideas and proven and tested principles from other domains of computer science and software engineering. In the last five years we have witnessed a qualitative leap, by virtue of which the web is now a computing platform with the added benefits of immediate availability of data, code and real-time collaboration. It has thus become the preferred medium for scientists of all disciplines to publish their research, along with visualisation software that can be reused and iterated. The following 10 rules offer guidelines learnt from our experience building and sharing data-driven web applications to maximise the benefits that users and developers can get from our software.
